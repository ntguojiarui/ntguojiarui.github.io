    title: Biography
    summary: |

      I am a Ph.D. student in School of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1230/2031.htm">Xiaolin Wang</a> 
      and Prof. <a href="https://yangtonghome.github.io/">Tong Yang</a>. My research interests include inference optimization in LLM, quantization algorithms for large models, and sketching algorithms in data streams. 
      I also work as a research intern at ByteDance. Before I start my Ph.D. degree, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Peking University in 2023.
